## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:
* Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed.

* Vite - You're going to use the [Vite Package Manager](https://vitejs.dev) to manage your front-end packages. Make sure you've installed Node.js and npm first, then install vite globally using npm:

```bash
$ npm install -g vite

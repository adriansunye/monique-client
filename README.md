## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:
* Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed.
* Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager. If you encounter any problems, you can also use this [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) to install Node.js.
* Vite - You're going to use the [Vite Package Manager](https://vitejs.dev) to manage your front-end packages. Make sure you've installed Node.js and npm first, then install vite globally using npm:

```bash
$ npm install -g vite
```

### Installing

We will start by installing dependencies

```
npm install
```

And runing on our local machine using vite

```
npm run dev
```
